#BussinessForecasting-WalmartSaleAnalysis
I am currently pursuing my masters in IT and Analytics at Rutgers. I am forecasting Walmart sales data for 45 stores on a weekly basis. 

We will implementing time series on the date feature in format YYYY-MM-DD. The data set comes from Kaggle and is available at this [link|https://www.kaggle.com/c/walmart-recruiting-store-sales-forecasting/data]. This forecast will attempt to help alleviate issues related to inventory and sales during holidays and other events that effect inventory and sales. We will use a combination of forecasting accuracy methods including but not limited to MAPE, MSE, RMSE.
We will also be forecasting 10 data points from the future where the actual data is not available.
