Mean for the standardised value is zero that is column Weeklysales2. The mean of standardized values will always be zero, and the standard deviation will always be one. The graph of standardized values will have exactly the same shape as the graph of raw data, but it may be a different size and have different coordinates.

#Naive - naive() is simply a wrapper to rwf() for simplicity.

```

```{r}
#stl -Forecasts of STL objects are obtained by applying a non-seasonal forecasting method to the seasonally adjusted data and re-seasonalizing using the last year of the seasonal component.
?stlf
